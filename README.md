# Real-time-3D-Human-Pose-Estimation-with-a-Single-RGB-Camera  
Demo Video at : https://youtu.be/jfeaQ9-S0AA
We have implemented the paper :”VNect: Real-time 3D Human Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Camera” by Mehta et al. from mpi-inf presented at SIGGRAPH 2017    

To run the code run mpii_vnect_demo_video.m and edit location of your matcaffe inside this file    
Keep the videos on which you have to run in the data folder  
Keep the model in the models folder   


We are thanful to D.Mehta at mpi-inf for the starter code and neural network models  
To obtain the models write to Dushyant Mehta (dmehta@mpi-inf.mpg.de)
